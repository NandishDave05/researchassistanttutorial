                            <p>Your college, like every academic institution, has published policies related to IP. Canada’s federal research agencies – Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)–  which fund a great majority of research conducted at Canadian universities and colleges, also require researchers to adhere to key IP laws. It is the responsibility of the academic institution to ensure that all research involving the college adheres to the appropriate IP and other laws.</p>

                            <p><strong>Formal agreements</strong> or <strong>contracts</strong> are put in place to detail the various aspects of the partnerships involving the college, industry or community organization and the research team. Some will involve you as a student and research assistant – and will require your signature.</p>
                            <p>Before you formally begin working on a project – whether it be in a course or outside of your coursework – you will be signing an agreement. Projects normally involve the following agreements:</p>

                                            <p><strong>Student Participation Agreement:</strong> The Research Department requires all RAs to acknowledge a Student Participation Agreement. This agreement is a <strong>legal contract</strong> between you and Humber, pertaining to the research to be conducted.</p>
                                            <p><strong>What is a Contract?</strong></p>
                                            <p>A contract is an oral or written agreement between two or more parties which is enforceable by law. It is a promise, or set of promises, where the breach of gives a remedy or the performance of the promise which creates a legally recognized obligation.</p>
                                            <p>In order for a contract to be <strong>enforceable</strong>, three elements are required: the contract has to be 1) offered; 2) accepted; and 3) properly considered, meaning that there were no prior conditions that would make the offer or the acceptance invalid. Examples of such conditions include not disclosing a conflict of interest and not being free to offer or accept.</p>
                                            <p>If either party to the agreement breaks any of the conditions necessary to fulfill the contract, they are said to be in <strong>breach of</strong> the contract.</p>
                                            <p>An example of a few statements in the agreement (contract) are as follows:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>The project name or academic course in which the research project will be conducted, the time period and location; </li>
                                                <li>The time commitment expected of you; </li>
                                                <li>A description of the IP to be created: you will be waiving your rights to any IP that is created – this means you will not own any design, prototype that you work on as part of the project, and so you will not be able to monetize it;   </li>
                                                <li>Confidentiality/Non-disclosure: you agree NOT to disclose any confidential information you are made aware of during the project to third parties. <strong>It is important that you are clear on what you can and cannot talk about with others outside of the project team.</strong> Typical examples of what partner companies do <u>not</u> wish the research team to disclose include: the details of what is being researched or tested, like mechanism or process being studied in the project, the chemical formula being created, the market insights and competitive analysis being conducted, business and operational details of the company – anything that, when disclosed, could affect the company’s competitive advantage in the market.</li>
                                                <li>Conflict of interest: you guarantee that you have no way of benefitting financially or otherwise from the project; for example, that you are not related to the partner’s stakeholders. If you perceive that a conflict of interest may occur, you need to disclose it promptly to your faculty or project supervisor;</li>
                                                <li>Workplace safety standards: ensure you know what these are, specific to the project, partner and industry;</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Often separate from the Student Participation Agreement is a <strong>media release form</strong> stating you agree to have your photo or video related to the project released for promotional or educational purposes.</p>
                                            <p>If you are being paid for your work, you will also sign an <strong>employment (non-full-time or NFT) contract</strong> with the college – more on this in the next section.</p>

                                            <p><strong>IP Transfer Agreement:</strong> In some (rare) cases, the owner of the IP, which is normally the partner organization, may decide to transfer the IP to another entity: the research team, including the students, or another party. IP can also be shared between the partner and the researcher(s) or the research team. An IP Transfer Agreement does this by defining who will own the IP and any related terms. Typically, the college does not want to own IP and will not accept an IP transfer.</p>
