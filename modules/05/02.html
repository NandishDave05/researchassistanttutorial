                            <p>A literature review is a summary, synthesis, and critical analysis of the existing work on a topic relevant to a research project. In other words, it is a snapshot of what is already known about the topic under investigation.</p>
                            <p>As you can probably imagine, if a researcher picks a research question that is too broad (for example, What do Canadians think about same sex marriage?), one of the many drawbacks is that the literature review will be impossibly long. Lit reviews are helpful in narrowing the focus of a research project (a more manageable research question might be, What are some rationales stated by same-sex Texan couples who choose to get married in Toronto?), but there are plenty of other reasons why wise researchers conduct literature reviews.</p>

                            <p>Have you ever found yourself at a party and drifted into a group conversation? How likely is it that you would just jump in, without standing for a moment to observe what is being said? Research librarian Charlene Kellsey reminds us that research is a form of scholarly conversation and that it is incumbent upon researchers to listen before speaking, just as in a group conversation in a party setting (2005). Before beginning a research project, it is vital that researchers make themselves aware of what has been done and what is currently being done in this field.</p>

                                        <h4>1. Literature reviews are helpful in the design phase of a research project.</h4>

                                        <p>If you are faced with a daunting task, one way to set about doing it is to see how others have done it. The same is true for a research project. A review of othersâ€™ work in your topic can give you lots of ideas. How have participants been successfully recruited? How have others analysed their data? Simply put, what are the best ways to seek an answer to your research question?</p>

                                        <p>The work of others may encourage you to make important adjustments to you research design - or abandon it entirely. As Northey et al. point out, â€œsomeone may have [already] demonstrated that it is impossible to answer the question you are askingâ€ (2009). For that reason alone, aside from all the others, literature reviews are very worthwhile endeavours!</p>

                                        <p>Literature reviews may be critical to ensuring your data collection tools are as sharp as they need to be. Bouma et al. offer us a great example:</p>

                                        <p>The literature review can be central to identifying factors that you may not have considered including in your research project. [Consider a] research project on the causes of youth unemployment. A small but growing part of the literature on this topic reveals that family contexts, such as the presence of both father and mother plus the birth order of siblings, are a major determinant of post-secondary school attendance. Youth who live in two-parent-headed households and who are the youngest siblings have the greatest chance of attending and completing university. If you do not review the existing literature on youth unemployment, you may forget to include questions about family context and birth order, making your research open to criticism and much less valuable once it is completed. (Blouma, Ling, & Wilkinson, 2012)</p>

                                        <p>Some topics benefit from repeated experimentation. For example, findings showing that a new type of grammar software that benefits a small sample group of dyslexic students would be strengthened by being repeated with a larger sample size. Often, however, researchers like to know that their work is advancing knowledge in a unique way. As Bouma, Ling, and Wilkinson put it, â€œitâ€™s not worth your time to replicate a study that has already been conducted. Funders will not want to support research questions that have already been answeredâ€ (2012).</p>

                                        <p>Literature reviews can help researchers find the gap: the small, focused place their work fits. For example, a researcher might discover studies examining the influence of advertising on 5-10 year olds and another study examining the influence of advertising on 13-19 year olds. The gap, therefore, lies in the 10-13 year old range. Perfect! That is exactly where they might choose to focus their research. But until they learn what has been done, they cannot isolate their unique contribution.</p>

                                        <p>All research projects wrap up with the presentation and interpretation of findings. This part of the research process is vastly improved when a researcher can connect these findings with the prevailing thinking on his or her topic.</p>

                                        <p>Once data have been analyzed, a good researcher often returns to her literature reviews and reflects on how her project contributes to the existing research. Perhaps the findings seem to contradict a previous study: why might that be? Perhaps the findings support conclusions drawn in other similar research projects; that is also of interest. A shrewd researcher might poke around to ensure he is up to speed with any new developments that have taken place in this field while he was busy collecting data. The literature review might need an update, and the new discoveries might enhance the data analysis and presentation of findings.</p>
