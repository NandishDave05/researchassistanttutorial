                            <div class="image-float-right max-50">
                                <img src="images/stack-of-books.jpg" alt="">
                                <p class="caption"><cite>Source: Coprid/Shutterstock.com</cite></p>
                            </div>
                            <p>The first step to writing a literature review is finding sources. Typically, the sources for a literature review come from peer-reviewed, academic journals. Articles published in peer-reviewed journals are (typically) subject to high levels of scrutiny from experts in the field. For this reason, they tend to be very credible.</p>

                            <p>Many peer-reviewed academic journals require subscriptions, but you are in luck: if you are a student, your right to access these journals is included in the cost of your tuition. (And if, for some reason, you cannot access a journal, your research supervisor will likely be able to connect you with it).</p>


                            <p>There are several effective strategies for finding relevant sources:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>One is to experiment with key words during your search. If you are not having much luck, librarians tend to be excellent resources and can suggest alternative search terms.</li>
                                <li>Another strategy is to locate one excellent source and read the references section contained therein. You will likely see many relevant sources there (and the search will only broaden as you consult the references section in those sources).</li>
                                <li>Some social scientists recommend beginning with the most recent articles and moving backwards.</li>
                                <li>Others suggest beginning with the â€œbig names,â€ the most notable, reputable thinkers in the field, and then widening out from there.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="space"></div>
                            <h4>Step 2: Writing the Literature Review</h4>
                            <p>Some people choose to write an entry for each relevant source they locate. Most researchers, however, would probably agree that the best lit reviews are organized much like an ordinary essay: there is an <strong>introduction</strong>, a <strong>body</strong>, and a <strong>conclusion</strong>. This way all of the research projects can be elegantly compared.</p>

                            <div class="tabs">
                                <!-- Nav tabs -->
                                <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
                                    <li class="active"><a href="#tab-1" data-toggle="tab" aria-expanded="true">Introduction</a></li>

                                    <li class=""><a href="#tab-3" data-toggle="tab" aria-expanded="false">Conclusion</a></li>
                                </ul>

                                    <div class="tab-pane fade active in" id="tab-1">
                                        <p>In the intro, typically the research question or research objective is stated first. That will focus readers on the theme of the lit review. Next, the major thinking in the area is summarized and possibly organized into the camps that will be explored in the body of the lit review.</p>

                                            <p class="bold italic">According to research, almost 60% of Canadian adults are overweight or obese (Tjepkema & Sheilds, 2005). This obesity epidemic has been linked to several behaviours, including poor diet and lack of exercise, and has led to over 57,000 deaths between 1985 and 2000 (Katzmarzyk & Ardern, 2004). In addition, inadequate nutrition and a sedentary lifestyle have been identified as co-factors in the development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression. To date, a number of research studies have investigated the use of disease education, diet interventions, or exercise to treat obesity. However, the majority of these studies have found these methods alone to be ineffective at achieving long-term success. As such, there is a substantial gap in our understanding of the use of intensive lifestyle intervention strategies to reduce the incidences of obesity and improve individuals overall quality of life.</p>

                                        <p>The body of the lit review delves a little deeper in to the sources. Remember, a lit review is more than a summary. It must critique the sources and show the similarities, differences, strengths, weaknesses, and unique aspects of the existing work in this area. Research projects can be organized in terms of themes for clarity. Northey et al. argue that a good literature review is organized around ideas, not sources, too many paragraphs that begin with the name of the researchers (Ludwig and Martin report, Johannes and Mutabo have found) is a hint that the review is organized too much around sources and not enough around ideas (2009).</p>

                                            <p class="bold italic">In a recent publication entitled The Future of Medical Education in Canada, it was recommended that basic science and clinical instruction be increasingly integrated so that students think about clinical applications as they learn basic sciences and about scientific principles as they learn clinical skillsâ€ (Association of the Faculties of Medicine of Canada, 2010). The medical education literature provides evidence for the value of basic science knowledge and its role in clinical diagnosis. In a study that assessed the value of learning basic science explanations for diagnostic categories compared to learning probability estimates associated with the features of a disease, it was found that students who had learned basic science explanations showed more accurate diagnostic performance after a time delay (Woods, Brooks & Norman, 2005). In a series of additional experiments, Woods and colleagues (2007) demonstrated that basic science knowledge relating causal mechanisms to disease symptoms improved diagnostic accuracy in novices in the long-term. Recent research also suggests that integrating basic and clinical science education results in higher visual diagnostic accuracy in novices immediately after learning and also after a time delay (Baghdady et al., 2012). Baghdady et al. (2012) demonstrated that students who had learned bony abnormalities using basic science descriptions simultaneously with radiographic features outperformed those who were taught using a segregated approach where the basic disease mechanisms were separated from the radiographic features by only minutes. Together, these studies suggest a role for basic science knowledge in providing a coherent conceptual framework that can be used by novice diagnosticians to reorganize and reconstruct diagnostic feature lists associated with abnormal functioning when solving clinical problems.</p>

                                            <p class="bold italic">The treatment of diabetes ranges from lifestyle changes to pharmacological interventions. The goal of most interventions is to lower and stabilize blood glucose levels, with the focus being on the latter better glycemic control (Al-Khawalden, Al-Hassan, Froelicher, 2012). It has been suggested that massage therapy may have an effect on regulation of blood glucose (Ezzo, Donner, Nickols, Cox, 2001). Although the mechanism by which this might occur is unclear, it has been suggested that massage therapy may help the body to improve insulin absorption, regulate blood glucose levels, and impact neuropathy.</p>

                                            <p class="bold italic">Perhaps more important than these potential benefits is the possible risk to patients if massage therapy reduces blood glucose to the point of inducing hypoglycemia. It is important to know if massage therapy might be contraindicated for individuals with unstable blood glucose or those who enter the massage therapy treatment with low blood glucose levels. It is with these possible benefits and risks in mind that this study is proposed.</p>
