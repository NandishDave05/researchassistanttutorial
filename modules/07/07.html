                        <p class="mb20">By now, the researcher has probably thought about what she hopes to discover from the data. Sometimes, this is called choosing a qualitative approach. Look at some of the different approaches she might take:</p>

                        <div class="panel panel-default callout mb40">
                            <div class="panel-body calloutpanelbody">
                                <div class="image-float-right max-50">
                                    <img src="images/woman-thinking.jpg" alt="image of a woman holding a pen to her chin, thinking." class="img-responsive">
                                    <p class="caption mb20"><cite>Source: mimagephotography/Shutterstock.com</cite></p>
                                </div>

                                <ol class="nomb">
                                    <li class="mb20">She might see how often words in observed conversations and interview transcripts are repeated, assuming that their frequency says something about the values and beliefs held by the rugby players. This approach is referred to as <span class="bold">content analysis</span>, and many feel it is a place where quantitative and qualitative research methods come together.</li>

                                    <li class="mb20">She might read through all the data again and again until themes begin to coalesce. For example, she might notice that the players rarely discuss their performance in their classes, and when they do, it is to reassure each other that academics is secondary in importance to athletics. She may then formulate a theory that the rugby team is a place where poor academic performance is enabled. This approach is referred to as <span class="bold">grounded theory</span>.</li>

                                    <li class="mb20">She might examine how words and phrases are used to establish and reinforce role, status, power, and respect. For example, she might look at words and phrases that are meant to encourage good performance and words and phrases that are meant to discourage poor performance. This approach is called <span class="bold">discourse analysis</span>.</li>

                                    <li class="mb20">She might carefully scrutinize conversations between team members to better understand the rules and structure of talk and interaction. For example, she might examine the implied power dynamic in who gets to use whose nickname and when or who gets to speak to the coach about what. This approach is called <span class="bold">conversation analysis</span>.</li>

                                    <li class="nomb">Finally, she might have asked each team member to tell the “story” of the team: how they came together, what the tryouts were like, when they felt like they began to bond as a team, and what were there most challenging moments. She might use these stories to reveal what aspects of team membership mean the most to players and whether there are patterns or contrasting information in their recollection. This approach is called <span class="bold">narrative analysis</span>.</li>
                                </ol>                               
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p class="space-sm">By no means is this an exhaustive list of what kind of data can be collected. As you have learned, even asking the team to snap photos of significant things can be a legitimate qualitative approach!</p>

                        <p>Also, qualitative researchers face unique challenges during the data analysis phase of research projects. As Marshall and Rossman note (1999, p.50),</p>

                        <blockquote class="custom nomb">
                            <p class="bold italic">[Qualitative] data analysis is the process of bringing order, structure, and interpretation to the mass of collected data. It is a messy, ambiguous, time-consuming, creative, and fascinating process. It does not proceed in a linear fashion: it is not neat.</p>
                        </blockquote>
