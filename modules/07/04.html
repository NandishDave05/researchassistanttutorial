                        <p>Often, quantitative researchers are interested in averages. This is partly because in order to understand how odd or unusual a phenomenon is, it is necessary to establish a “norm.” Averages are also critical for understanding change. For example, a researcher might want to know if all low-income children are offered breakfast programs at school does the average grade in the class improve, and if so, by what extent?</p>

                        <p>There are three ways to understand an average, or as some like to call it, a mid-point: the mean, the median, and the mode.</p>

                                    <p>Most people are thinking about a <span class="bold">mean</span> when they think of the word “average.” A mean is calculated by adding all values together and then dividing that number by the number of values. For example, if the marks in a (small) classroom were:</p>

                                    <blockquote class="custom no-quote">
                                        <p>12, 62, 68, 68, 77, 78, 98</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>Researchers would calculate the <span class="bold">mean</span> by adding all the values together,</p>

                                    <blockquote class="custom no-quote">
                                        <p>12 + 62 + 68 + 68 + 77 + 78 + 98 = 460</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>and then dividing that number by the number of students.</p>

                                    <blockquote class="custom no-quote">
                                        <p>460 / 7= 65.7</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>The mean mark in this classroom is <span class="bold">65.7%</span>.</p>

                                    <p>The problem with using mean calculations is that they are dramatically affected by the outliers: the very highs and the very lows. You’ll notice that one poor soul in our sample classroom is scoring a 12%. This number is skewing the mid-point so that even though the majority of students are scoring between 68-78%, the <span class="bold">mean</span> suggests the midpoint is much lower. Too often, when students calculate their own average, they feel that they are performing overly well – or rather poorly – because the marks of the non-attending students, who can even have a 0% on their midterm transcript – are skewing the class average low, or the very rare, high achieving students with a 98% are skewing it high.</p>



                                </div>
                                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tab-2">
                                    <div class="space visible-xs"></div>

                                    <p>Another way of calculating a “midpoint” that is not affected by outlier values is the median. Researchers who are using small numbers of very diverse values often choose to calculate the median.</p>

                                    <p>It is a pretty straightforward calculation: first, all the values are lined up in ascending order. Then the researcher counts down from the top and up from the bottom until she reaches the value that is right in the middle.</p>

                                    <blockquote class="custom no-quote">
                                        <p>12, 62, 68, <span class="bold">68</span>, 77, 78, 98</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>Using our example, we arrive at 68% (three values above, and three below). Recall that our mean for this set of values was 65.7%. That’s a pretty big difference!</p>

                                    <p>There are some limitations to using the median to show a midpoint. In this example, our median mark is 68%. That tells us that there is an equal number of values about this number and an equal number below – but it doesn’t show the <span class="bold">range</span> of those values. There could very well be three students in the low sixties and three more in the low seventies. Alternatively, three students could be scoring less than 10%, and three students could be scoring in the high nineties. In both cases, the median would still be 68%. Without describing the range of scores, a person reviewing our data would not get a sense of the <span class="bold">spread</span> of marks in the class.</p>

                                    <p>That’s why some quantitative researchers choose to demonstrate the range by subtracting the lowest value from the highest.</p>

                                    <blockquote class="custom no-quote">
                                        <p>12, 62, 68, 68, 77, 78, 98</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>In our sample case, the range is 86%, which we got by subtracting 12 (our lowest value) from 98 (our highest value). Some researchers like to report the range when they calculate the median.</p> 
                                </div>

                                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tab-3">
                                    <div class="space visible-xs"></div>

                                    <p>The third technique to calculate a midpoint is the mode. The mode refers to the value that <span class="bold">repeats itself most frequently</span> in the data.</p>

                                    <p>Again, using our same example:</p>

                                    <blockquote class="custom no-quote">
                                        <p>12, 62, 68, 68, 77, 78, 98</p>
                                    </blockquote>

                                    <p>We note that the mode is 68. That means that the largest group of students in our sample class is scoring a 68%.</p>

                                    <p>The advantage to using a mode calculation is that the mode, like the median, is also not affected by outliers. However, sometimes there can be <span class="bold italic">two sets</span> of values that are repeated most frequently and must share the mode designation. That can be a bit unwieldy for some researchers, who prefer using a median or a mean.</p>
