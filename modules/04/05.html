                            <p>Some students completing this course may have experience working in team settings, while others may not. Teamwork requires skills that are helpful in both academic and professional settings. Although teamwork can present unique challenges, everyone should welcome the opportunity to sharpen their proficiency in a skillset that will be valuable now and in the future.</p>

                            <p>One element that can make or break the effectiveness of teams is communication. During your time as a research assistant, you will probably find that you are often required to use good communication skills in two particular settings: face-to-face meetings and email.</p>

                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-sm-6">
                                    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/face-to-face.jpg">
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-sm-6">
                                    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/email2.jpg">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div class="space-md"></div>

                            <p>Let's review the former first. Most research supervisors like to get their teams together two or more times per month during the research process. At least one meeting will likely happen during the initial stages of the research. It is likely your supervisor will use this time to introduce him or herself as well as the other members of the team. She or he will also outline the basic direction of the project, delegate some tasks, and answer any questions you might have. It would be a BIG mistake to miss this crucial meeting. Your effectiveness as a research assistant is entirely contingent on your understanding of the project's focus.</p>

                            <p>Email is the second way that you may be asked to keep in touch with your team and with your research supervisor. If you are a member of a team of research assistants, you may note that your supervisor will email all of you at once. This does not mean that you need to do the same by hitting "reply all;" if you need to reply, make sure your comment or question is addressed only to those who need to read it. Also, it is expected that you use professional and courteous language in emails with your research supervisor and any other members of your team. This is a job, after all: no emoticons, no text slang¬ù and be sure to begin your email with a polite salutation and end with a friendly and professional sign off. Professional language tends to increase the confidence your peers and supervisors have in you and your work. Learning how to communicate via email in a professional and courteous tone are skills you will most certainly use for the rest of your life, so begin now.</p>

                            <p>Finally, good communication means being an <strong>active listener.</strong> This is true in both meeting and email contexts. Being an active listener in a meeting includes taking notes if necessary, making eye contact, and <strong>turning off your phone and tucking it away.</strong> Active listening in email contexts means fully reading an email before responding to it. When you ask a question that has already been clearly answered, you embarrass yourself and annoy others.</p>
