                            <p>Tom Kendrick, author of <strong>The Project Management Toolkit (2010)</strong>, identifies the following four most common sources of conflict:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Overlapping responsibility</li>
                                <li>Differing cultures, viewpoints, perspectives, and backgrounds</li>
                                <li>Misunderstandings</li>
                                <li>Lack of trust and relationships</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="space-md"></div>
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/conflict.jpg">
                            <p class="caption"><cite>Source: ESB Professional/Shutterstock.com</cite></p>
                            <div class="space-md"></div>
                            <p>In all of these, he recommends a <span class="italic">preventative</span> approach to conflict by focusing on clarity of communication. This means clearly defining what needs to be done and unambiguously delegating who is in charge of what.</p>
                            <p>He also recommends periodic face-to-face meetings to address any small issues before they grow into larger ones. In meetings, Kendrick suggests staying on track. Clarifying questions are permitted, he says, but narrowly focus on facts and data, not on personality and emotion. Use active listening, paraphrasing, constructive feedback, and open questions to gain understanding.¬ù</p>
                            <p>Reconfirming plans at the outset of any new task can help clarify others obligations. For example, "Alright everyone, today we're here to recruit as many people as possible to complete this survey." In general, conflicts are far less likely to arise when people are clear about what they must do and what others are doing. But even so, sometimes people don't do what they said they would. What then?</p>
                            <p>Project management expert Stanley Portny likes to boil it down to one main principle: people who take responsibility should also accept accountability. Holding people accountable is appropriate and necessary when they've accepted responsibility, he writes. If you are responsible for managing other research assistants, and they fail to meet their obligations to the team, it may be necessary for you to step in (and take your own responsibility as their manager!).</p>
                            <p>Typically, you will notice some warning signs that a person has a waning commitment to a project; this often manifests initially as absenteeism from meetings and other commitments or not returning emails promptly. Seizing these early moments to have an open, non-judgmental check in with the person about their ability to remain engaged with the project may avoid some bigger, more troubling letdowns later.</p>
                            <p>If you have been tasked with overseeing the work of others, and if you feel conflicts are arising, it is very important that you loop in your supervising researcher. He or she will want to know what's going on and how you plan to deal with it. As is true of any job, supervisors like to be presented with solutions when being approached with a problem. Your insight into the on-the-ground issues is valuable, so don't be shy to share it.</p>
