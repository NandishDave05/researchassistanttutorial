                            <p>It is often said that research is &ldquo;systematic.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;systematic&rdquo; suggests that there is a <em>system</em>: in other words, a research <strong>plan</strong> that guides researchers to reliable conclusions. This plan is often referred to as <strong>the research process</strong>: the most reliable, efficient approach to generating knowledge. A flawed research process, as you can imagine, generates flawed, untrustworthy results. For this reason, it is crucial that researchers understand the steps in the research process prior to designing a project.</p>

                                        <p>A The Monster Study (1939)
                                            
                                            The Monster Study was an experiment conducted on 22 orphan children in Davenport, Iowa, in 1939 by Wendell Johnson at the University of Iowa. Johnson chose one of his graduate students, Mary Tudor, to conduct the experiment. The children were placed in control and experimental groups where half of the children received positive speech therapy, praising the fluency of their speech, while the other half received a negative speech therapy, belittling and undermining the children’s ability in speech and calling out on every mistake and telling the children they were stutterers. The majority of the normal speaking orphan children who received negative therapy in the study suffered from negative psychological effects, and some of them retained speech problems during the course of their life. Later the experiment was dubbed “The Monster Study” by some of Johnson’s peers who were horrified that Johnson would experiment on orphan children to prove a theory. The University of Iowa publicly apologized for the Monster Study in 2001.</p>

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and lasted from 2004 until 2009.

                                                <p>Consent forms given to parents to sign were approved by local ethics committees, but did not include an adequate description of the risks to the premature infants, said Michael Carome, deputy director of the Health Research Group.</p>
                                                
                                                <p>On April 10, Public Citizen issued a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the NIH, calling for an apology to all the parents who entered their children in the study, according to the New Haven Register.</p>
                                                
                                                
                                                <p>The 1,300 premature babies enrolled as subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The first received high levels of oxygen exposure, which Carome said increases the risk of eye injury or blindness, while the second received low levels of oxygen exposure, which Carome said increases the risk of brain damage and death. but the consent forms did not clearly stipulate any of these risks, instead “misleading” parents, Carome added.</p>
                                                
                                                <p>“Consent is an absolutely essential ethical requirement, and we consider this research highly unethical,” he said. “The Department of Health and human Services should apologize to parents of the children and that apology should be accompanied by a detailed description of what they weren’t told.”</p>
